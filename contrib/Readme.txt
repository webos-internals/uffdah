The scripts included in this directory ( /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosinternals.saverestore/contrib ) are scripts that have been provided in the PreCentral forums but have not been released within the Save/Restore App itself.  These are considered more complex scripts that may not be needed for the general population.

There are currently 4 scripts in this folder, plus two executable (sr-acal and sr-acsp). 

The 4 scripts are:

1. com.palm.app.backup - Misc OS Backup Files + AutoReplace
    > This file replaces the existing com.palm.app.backup file in the scripts directory (that currently only saves the AutoReplace Dictionary).  This expanded script also saves: a variety of system and phone images that a user may customize, the PalmDatabase.db3, cookies.db, Databases.db, systemprefs.db, and all the /dev/tokens/.  Note that the only the images are included in a restore, not the database files or the tokens

2. com.palm.app.deviceinfo - Misc OS Backup Files (without AutoReplace)
    > This file is identical to the script above, except that it does not include the AutoReplace Dictionaries.  This way, you can copy this script to the app and it (1) won't get replaced with every update to the app and (2) will not duplicate the existing AutoReplace Dictionary saves.

3. org.webosinternals.saverestore - ZZZ Save Restore Zip Creation
    > This files creates a ZIP file called saverestore-(timestamp).zip with a zipped up version of your entire save/restore directory [replacing (timestamp) with the actual timestamp]! Right now this is placed in the USB root directory (i.e /media/internal), although you can of course modify this. The script It is named "ZZZ Save Restore Zip creation" so that it appears at the very bottom of the save/restore installed apps list and will therefore will always be run last.

4. com.palm.app.photos - This will ZIP up all the files in your /media/internal/DCIM/ directory.  
    > This directory contains all the photos you have taken with your Camera and all the videos from your camcorder.  
    > This can be used to create backups of these directories for uploading to a cloud-storage app while not near a computer
    > Note, this will save any directory under /DCIM (e.g. 100PALM, 101PALM), including any directories you may have manually added
  
In order to get these files into your scripts directory, you need to do one of the following 2 things: 

1) Run the following to command via Command Line (replacing [script name] with the name of the script you want
    >  cp /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosinternals.saverestore/contrib/[script name] /var/svc/org.webosinternals.saverestore

2) using Internals:
    > Go to /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosinternals.saverestore/contrib/
    > Select each script you want and select "copy" to /var/svc/org.webosinternals.saverestore


The three executable (sr-acal, sr-acsp, sr-acsp-w) are ways for you to easily run the script to SAVE your preferences for "Advanced Configuration for App Launcher" (acal) patch or "Advanced Configuration for System Preferences" (acsp).  To use these script, you need to do:
NOTE1: If you are using the World edition of "Advanced Configuration for System Preferences", you need to run the "sr-acsp-w" file
NOTE2: These only work in webOS 1.4.5 and lower.  These scripts are not currently compatible with webOS 2.0 and higher
1. copy these script to the /var/home/root directory of your device by either:
     1) Run the following to command via Command Line: cp /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosinternals.saverestore/contrib/sr-acal /var/home/root
     2) using Internals, go to /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosinternals.saverestore/contrib/, and tap sr-acal or sr-acsp or sr-acsp-w, "copy" to /var/home/root (top level).  
2. At any time, load up Terminal (you should already be in /var/home/root) and just type "sr-acal" or "sr-acsp" or "sr-acsp-w" (without the quotes)
